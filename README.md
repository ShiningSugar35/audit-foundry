# My Smart Contract Auditing Sandbox (DVDF Solutions)

This repository serves as my personal solution set and auditing sandbox for the **Damn Vulnerable DeFi (DVDF)** challenges, implemented in Foundry.

[cite_start]My goal is to use this project to build a verifiable portfolio of my smart contract security auditing and exploit development skills, as part of my journey to become a Web3 protocol and security engineer.My solutions and exploit contracts are located in the `/test` directory.
